This course examines the choices and constraints regarding sources and uses of energy by households, firms, and governments through a number of frameworks to describe and explain behavior at various levels of aggregation. Examples include a wide range of countries, scope, settings, and analytical approaches.

This course is one of many [OCW Energy Courses](/courses/energy-courses/), and it is a core subject in MIT's undergraduate [Energy Studies Minor](http://mitei.mit.edu/education/energy-minor/). This Institute-wide program complements the deep expertise obtained in any major with a broad understanding of the interlinked realms of science, technology, and social sciences as they relate to energy and associated environmental challenges.
